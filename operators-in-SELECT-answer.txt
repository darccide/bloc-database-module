      <optional: WHERE <condition>>

2. Create a fun way to remember the order
   of operations in a SELECT statement, 
   such as a mnemonic.

5. From the cats table, write queries to select
   the following pieces of data.
   * Display all the information about all of 
     the available cats.
   * Display the name and sex of all cats who 
     are 7 years old.
   * Find all of the names of the cats, so you 
     don't choose duplicate names for new cats.

   A: 

      * Display all the information about all of 
        the available cats.

      * SELECT * 
        FROM cats;

      * Display the name and sex of all cats who 
        are 7 years old.

      * SELECT name, gender
        FROM cats
        WHERE age = 7;

      * Find all of the names of the cats, so you
        don't choose duplicate names for new cats.

      * SELECT name
        FROM cats;

6. List each comparison operator and explain 
   when you would use it. Include a real world
   example for each.
  
   A: The comparison operators:
 
      * <
      * >
      * <=
      * >=
      * !=
      * =
      * LIKE

      I will bullet each real world example in a 
      corresponding order to my listing of each
      operator.

      * A real world example of this would be finding
        all the students in a certain grade who are 
        younger than a certain age. This could be highly
        useful in high schools for things like student
        parking or if a student gets into a physical 
        altercation with a minor and said student is 
        no longer a minor.

      * A real world example of this would be if you were 
        trying to catalog pension applicants and your 
        company has an age restriction on their pension 
        plan. Then you would want to know if someone was 
        born after a certain year in order to determine if 
        they qualify to withdraw.

      * A real world example of this would be if you wanted
        to create a notice for inventory replenishment at 
        a warehouse. Then you would want to know when you only 
        had a particular amount of a particular item.

      * A real world example of this can be highlighted by the
        idea, which comes from the real world, of the baker's 
        dozen. Since a dozen (12) would be required for something
        like a box of donuts, the bakery would want to make sure 
        they are baking 12 or more donuts at a time.

      * A real world example of this would be with students being 
        vaccinated for a particular virus at school. Say the school
        wanted non vaccinated students to get vaccinated they would
        want to search through a database by specifying they want to
        know the names of all the students who are not vaccinated.

      * A real world example of this would be the correcting of a
        wrong shipping order. If a person received the wrong 
        merchandise and called the company they would want to be
        able to check through their shipments either based off of
        a matching id number or even check all the shipment that have
        some of the same merchandise.

      * A real world example of using like would be if you were 
        doing a return at a store. The store clerk would want to
        be able to look up the returned item in the store's 
        inventory database even if they didn't know the exact name
        of the item, but knew part of the name.

7. From the cats table, what data is returned 
   from these queries?
   * SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = 'F';
   * SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
   * SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != 'Mushi 
     AND gender = 'M';

   A: 

      * SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = 'F';
    
      * The names of all the female cats will be returned.

      * SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
 
      * The names of all the cats who are not 3 years old.

      * SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != 'Mushi 
        AND gender = 'M'; 

      * The ID of all the cats who are not named "Mushi" and are male.
