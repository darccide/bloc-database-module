   2. 42
   3. 09/02/1945
   4. 98.7
   5. $15.99

  A: 
     1. string
     2. integer

     4. float
     5. currency

2. Explain when a database would be used. 
   Explain when a text file would be used.

   A: We would use a database when we need a way to 
      store data that makes it easy to find specific 
      data, that can handle more than one application 
      accessing the data, and it persists beyond the end
      of a particular application process.

      We would use a text file when we need to store 
      data outside of an application and we don't need
      any of the extra conditions fulfilled by 
      databases.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other 
   programming languages.

   A: One difference between SQL and other programming
      languages is that the equality symbol is used in 
      the same as with numbers. The equality is exact. 
      For instance, 'Mike' = 'mike' would not be the 
      case in SQL.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a 
   database system fit together at a high level.

   A: A database system starts with data. If you do not
      have data, then you cannot have a meaningful 
      database. Said data is laid out in a table.
      A table is constructed of rows and columns. 
      The columns are labeled based upon what value
      is stored in the column. Every cell of a 
      particular column will have a value that is of the 
      same type in relation to the other cells in the 
      column. The rows will display an individual 
      instance of meaningful data representation. 

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

   A: 

      Table: A data structue, made of rows and columns,
             that stores and displays data.

      Row: An individual, implicitly structured data 
           item in a table.

      Column: A set of data values, each value of a 
              common type, one value for each row in 
              the table.

      Value: An actual piece of data. 

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

   A: Three data types that can be used in a table are
      text, numbers, and date.

7. Given this payments table, provide an English 
   description of the following queries and include 
   their results:

   SELECT date, amount
   FROM payments;

   SELECT amount
   FROM payments
   WHERE amount > 500;

   SELECT *
   FROM payments
   WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';

   A: 

      Note: All double quotes are meant to be used in 
            relation to English and are not meant to 
            denote strings particularly as this 
            specific exercise is about SQL which 
            denotes strings using single quotes.

      SELECT date, amount
      FROM payments;

      An English description would be SELECT two
      columns, date and amount, FROM the payments table
      The result would be just these two columns and 
      their respective data being displayed next to each
      other

      SELECT amount
      FROM payments
      WHERE amount > 500;

      An English description would be SELECT one column,
      amount, FROM the payments table WHERE the amount
      is greater than 500. The result would be a column
      with the title "amount" and only one value, 
      1500.00, since that is the only value in the 
      column that satifies the query's condition.

      SELECT *
      FROM payments
      WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';

      An English description would be SELECT all the 
      columns for the set of rows FROM payments WHERE 
      payee is equal to "Mega Foods". The result would
      be the single row from the table showing the
      "date" column with the single entry "2016-05-15"
      next to the "payee" column with the single entry
      "Mega Foods" next to the "amount" column with the 
      single entry "124.93" next to the "memo" column 
      with the single entry "Groceries" 
      

8. Given this users table, write SQL queries using the 
   following criteria and include the output:

   * The email and sign-up date for the user named 
     DeAndre Data.
   * The user ID for the user with email
     'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.
   * All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.

   A: 

      * The email and sign-up date for the user named 
        DeAndre Data.

        SELECT email, signup
        FROM users
        WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data';

      * The user ID for the user with email
        'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'. 

        SELECT userid
        FROM users
        WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu';  

      * All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.

        SELECT * 
        FROM users
        WHERE userid = 4;
